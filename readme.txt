Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow
This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning library. It utilizes the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.

Overview
The digits.model file included in this repository is a trained neural network model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. The model has been trained using the MNIST dataset and achieves high accuracy on test data.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
OpenCV (cv2)
Matplotlib

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yashc1712/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition.git

Run the script

Results
